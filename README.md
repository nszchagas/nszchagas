# Who am I?

- My name is Nicolas, I'm a 26 years old fullstack developer and software engineering (6th period) student at University of Brasília (UnB). 
- That's my second graduation, for I'm undegraduate in Mathematics, which I completed at University of Brasília (UnB) in 2018.
- I've been working as a fullstack developer since December of 2021, and was promoted from intern to trainee in May of 2022.
- Before working as a developer, I worked as a math teacher, between Fev/2019 and May/2022, and this work helped me develop soft skills while dealing with teens. 
- My resume is available [here](https://github.com/nszchagas/nszchagas/blob/main/nicolas_chagas_souza_cv.pdf).
- Currently I'm working mainly with Angular and Kotlin, but sometimes I also use Java, JSF, python and shellscript during work. 
- I'm a fast learner and driven by challenges, learning is my favorite hobby. Besides programming, I also like to study languages - mostlyEnglish, French and Spanish - and Math (which in some sort of way is also a language).
- I'm interested in the following areas: fullstack development and DevOPS.
